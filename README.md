**Project Description:** Modernization has led to different approaches and greater diversity of sound characteristics and range. In this project, I will be analyzing popular songs on Spotify over time and looking for common attributes and trends. If we can achieve insights from the data as to what attributes and trends are helpful for predicting a song's popularity, this will help musicians to understand what listeners prefer and how to compete in the music industry.

**Questions for EDA:**
- Can we predict a song's popularity based on attributes such as danceability, valence, loudness, and length?
- Are there any trends in the popularity of different music genres?
- How do song attributes differ according to different genres?
- How have the attributes of songs on Spotify's Top 2000 changed over time?

This repository contains my updated storyboards, poster, slides, Jupyter notebook, and “Spotify: All Time Top 2000 Mega Dataset”, a dataset taken from Kaggle which contains audio statistics and attributes for Spotify's top songs. The dataset is contained within a csv file and includes data on songs released from 1959 to 2019. The data set breaks down each song by the following attributes: genre, year, BPM, danceability, energy, loudness, liveness, valence, length, acousticness, speechiness, and popularity. I will be iterating on my storyboard and Jupyter notebook each week with feedback from my peers and course instructors.
